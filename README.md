# Setting up ETL of IBM Truven CCAE Files to CDM
This repo aims to streamline the preeffort to run the steps to set up and run the ETL processing of the CCAE files using theÂ  [ETL-LambdaBuilder Project](https://github.com/OHDSI/ETL-LambdaBuilder) maintained by [OHDSI](https://www.ohdsi.org/). This setup uses Gradle, a popular automation tool for multi-language software development. Gradle controls the development process from compilation and packaging to testing, deployment, and publishing.
