# Setting up ETL of IBM Truven CCAE Files to CDM
This repo automates the preparatory steps to set up and run the ETL processing of the CCAE files using theÂ  [ETL-LambdaBuilder Project](https://github.com/OHDSI/ETL-LambdaBuilder) maintained by [OHDSI](https://www.ohdsi.org/). This setup uses Gradle, a popular automation tool for multi-language software development. Gradle controls the development process from compilation and packaging to testing, deployment, and publishing.
